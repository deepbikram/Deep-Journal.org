### macOS: "App is damaged" Error

If you see a message saying "Deep Journal is damaged and can't be opened", this is a common macOS security feature (Gatekeeper) blocking unsigned applications. Here are several ways to resolve this:

3. **Navigate to your Downloads folder:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   ```
4. **Remove the quarantine attribute:**

   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "Deep Journal-1.2.2-arm64.dmg"
   ```
   (Replace with the exact filename you downloaded)
5. **Double-click the DMG** to open it normally

# After installing Deep Journal, re-enable it
sudo spctl --master-enable
```

### Windows: "Isn't commonly downloaded" Warning

If you see a message saying "Deep Journal isn't commonly downloaded. Make sure you trust it before opening", this is Windows Defender SmartScreen protecting you from unsigned software.

2. **Navigate to the downloaded file** in File Explorer
3. **Right-click the .exe file** ‚Üí **Properties**

1. **Try to run the .exe** (you'll get the SmartScreen warning)
2. **Click "More info"** in the warning dialog
3. **Click "Run anyway"** at the bottom
4. **Confirm** when prompted with User Account Control

#### Method 3: Disable SmartScreen Temporarily (Advanced)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Use with caution - this reduces your PC's security**

2. **Click "Reputation-based protection settings"**
3. **Turn off "Check apps and files"** temporarily

## üìã Which File to Download?

### macOS
- **Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3)**: Download `Deep Journal-1.2.3-arm64.dmg`
- **Intel Macs**: Download `Deep Journal-1.2.3.dmg`
- **Not sure?**: Click Apple menu ‚Üí About This Mac. If you see "Apple M1/M2/M3", use ARM64 version.

### Windows
- **Most users**: Download `Deep Journal Setup 1.2.3.exe` (installer)
- **Portable version**: Download `Deep Journal 1.2.3.exe` (no installation required)
- **System requirements**: Windows 10 or later (both 32-bit and 64-bit supported)

## üîí Why This Happens

### macOS Security Warning
This security warning appears because:
- Deep Journal is not code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate ($99/year)
- macOS protects users from potentially malicious software
- Open-source applications often face this limitation

### Windows Security Warning
This security warning appears because:
- Deep Journal is not code-signed with a Windows code signing certificate ($200+/year)
- Windows SmartScreen protects users from unrecognized software
- New releases need time to build "reputation" in Microsoft's systems
- Open-source applications often face this limitation

## ‚úÖ Is It Safe?

Yes! Deep Journal is:
- ‚úÖ **Open source** - all code is publicly available on GitHub
- ‚úÖ **No telemetry** - your data stays on your device
- ‚úÖ **Community verified** - transparent development process
- ‚úÖ **Regular updates** - active maintenance and security fixes
- ‚úÖ **Local-first** - no data sent to external servers
- ‚úÖ **Virus scanned** - all releases are scanned by GitHub's security systems

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

### macOS
If none of the macOS methods work:
1. **Check your macOS version** - ensure you're running a supported version (10.15+)
2. **Try the ZIP version** instead of DMG
3. **Open an issue** on GitHub with your macOS version and exact error message

### Windows
If none of the Windows methods work:
1. **Check your Windows version** - ensure you're running Windows 10 or later
2. **Try the portable version** instead of the installer
3. **Temporarily disable antivirus** (some third-party antivirus may block it)
4. **Open an issue** on GitHub with your Windows version and exact error message

## üîÑ Auto-Updates

Once installed, Deep Journal includes an auto-update system that will notify you of new versions and handle updates seamlessly.
